> ‚ÄúYour next soul-nourishing morning routine, all automating.‚Äù


## Problem Definition

It is hard to open your eyes and get out of your whole night sleep mode, refreshing quickly to close your alarm. In such situation, many people just close it insensibly and think we can safely assume that ‚ÄúI just take a nap in one minute‚Äù. Unfortunately, most of us delay too much time.

The second reason of that is the living atmosphere is not motivated and humanized enough for people to start a new day.

## Project Goals

This app is designed to provide sorts of choices for users to control their home devices. Such as bathtubs, home audios, kitchen utensils, etc.

After ringing of the alarm, the 'waking-up' system will begin with the contents that users had set one by one.

This auto-system will decrease users' morning laziness time in case oversleep and to build a humanized and comfortable get-up-atmosphere.

Overall, the main aim of the design concept is trying to improve efficiency and shorten the time before users prepare to go out.

## Who is the Client?

- The people who are going to wake up.
- The waking up people who is in the insobriety period.
- The people who are grumpy in the morning.
- The people who are trying to improve life quality, saving time. ...

Inspired by the Galleries feature from WordPress, we've made it easy to create grid layouts for your images. Just use a bit of simple HTML in your post to create a masonry grid image layout:

```html
<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-portrait.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-square.jpg">
    <img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>
```

*See what we did there? Code and syntax highlighting is built-in too!*

Change the number inside the 'columns' setting to create different types of gallery for all kinds of purposes. You can even click on each image to seamlessly enlarge it on the page.

### Image carousels

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape.jpg">
	<img src="/images/demo/demo-landscape-2.jpg">
</div>

### What about videos?

Videos are an awesome way to show off your work in a more engaging and personal way, and we‚Äôve made sure they work great on our themes. Just paste an embed code from YouTube or Vimeo, and the theme makes sure it displays perfectly:

<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/148003889" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
