## PROBLEM

Every roommate has their own schedule where they disturb each other's daily routine. Also waste time due to wait for each other reply for a long while. Also,roommates always don't know if they can make any noise cause of they don't know if their roommate at home or not and to be embarrassed about knocking at door for asking every time. 



## Solution
The roommates can get help with  each other based on knowing the presence of one another by this function.
Connecting with roommates in order to save time, provide convenient and improve life proficiency.

### Viusal Interface



<div class="gallery" data-columns="3">
	<img src="/images/dormie/landinglayout.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/create.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/horizontal.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/status.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/chatting.jpg">
	
	
</div>


I was trying to use bold but clean color system to build this interface more clearly for users. As this product is designed for students. To show the teenagers personality I create the illustrations of **HOUSES SELECTED** , **EMOJIS STATUS** or **AVATAR** to create the energetic and young stylish into the design

### Design Process

Here's another gallery with only one column, which creates a carousel slide-show instead.

A nice little feature: the carousel only advances when it is in view, so your visitors won't scroll down to find it half way through your images.

<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/dormie/userflow.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/wireframe.png">
</div>


<div class="gallery" data-columns="1">
	<img src="/images/dormie/1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/3.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/4.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/5.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/6.jpg">
	<img src="/images/dormie/7.jpg">
	
</div>
